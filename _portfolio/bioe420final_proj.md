This group project was completed as a part of my BIOE 420 Control Systems course taken at the end of my undergraduate journey in Bioengineering. This project involved designing a PID Controller in MATLAB/Simulink for properly dosing anaesthetic to an patient given a certain drug sensitivity. Our controller was among the top performing of all groups in the course in terms of steady state error and 10% settling time.
