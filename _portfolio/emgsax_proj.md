This project involved creating a functional prosthetic right hand which would theoretically enable those who have lost limb function to continue to play their favorite instruments in some capacity. The project involved creating an breadboard EMG system linked to an Arduino Uno for signal interpretation and finally to servo motors to control 3 saxophone keys. My role in this project was largely centered around the creation of the breadboard EMG circuit, which you can see on the right side of the table in this image of our exhibit booth at the fair.
