<h3>Live Application Demo</h3>

This application was created during my time in Dr. Sweeney's lab as an undergraduate for the purposes of speeding up data analysis and output directly from the fiber photometry setup we were using. Lab members could simply visit this R Shiny app online to directly upload both raw data and experiment specific data to get relevant stats and figures.
